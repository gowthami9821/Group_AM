Predicting RNA structure and assessing cancer risk from sequence data remains a challenge due to limited structural databases, complex folding, and fragmented tools. Most labs lack integrated, explainable, and privacy-preserving platforms for actionable cancer risk insights. Our project enables researchers to input RNA sequences, uses local agentic AI for structure prediction and cancer classification, and outputs clear, interpretable results all in one web interface. This accelerates cancer biomarker discovery, empowers clinicians, and ensures compliance, setting a new standard for accessible, explainable, and secure RNA-driven cancer diagnostics with next-generation AI.
