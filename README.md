# üß¨ Agentic RNA Biomarker Detection

## Problem Statement

Predicting RNA structure and assessing cancer risk from sequence data remains a challenge due to limited structural databases, complex folding, and fragmented tools. Most labs lack integrated, explainable, and privacy-preserving platforms for actionable cancer risk insights.

**Our project:** enables researchers to input RNA sequences, uses local agentic AI for structure prediction and cancer classification, and outputs clear, interpretable results all in one web interface. This accelerates cancer biomarker discovery, empowers clinicians, and ensures compliance, setting a new standard for accessible, explainable, and secure RNA-driven cancer diagnostics with next-generation AI.

## Overview

This project implements an **Agentic AI pipeline** for detecting **biomarker regions** in RNA 3D structures (`.pdb` files). It integrates structural bioinformatics tools and a locally running **BioGPT LLM** to automate the workflow ‚Äî from structure parsing to functional annotation. The project also demonstrates the integration of **LangChain** for orchestrating AI reasoning and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** for combining structured RNA data with external knowledge sources.

After detecting biomarker regions, the system can suggest **potential drug candidates** using molecular SMILES representations and **diffusion-based generative models** for virtual compound generation. Although this project currently uses BioGPT and the same process for analysis, this step demonstrates the potential for AI-assisted RNA-targeted drug discovery.

### Agentic AI Orchestrator

* Coordinates multiple tools:

  * Parses RNA `.pdb` files
  * Runs **fpocket** to detect potential binding pockets
  * Uses **LangChain** to manage AI reasoning and task planning
  * Utilizes **RAG techniques** to enhance BioGPT predictions with external databases (e.g., RNAcentral, PubMed)
  * Produces biomarker predictions in JSON format
  * Suggests drug candidates via SMILES-based reasoning and generative models

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ PDB Parser (Biopython)

* Extracts atomic coordinates, residue sequences, and secondary structure motifs from `.pdb` files
* Outputs structured JSON summarizing the RNA structure

**Example Output:**

```json
{
  "chains": ["A"],
  "residue_count": 46,
  "motifs_detected": ["stem-loop", "bulge"],
  "sequence": "AUGCUAGU..."
}
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ fpocket

* Detects **binding pockets/cavities** in RNA structures
* Provides pocket coordinates, volumes, hydrophobicity, and druggability score

**Example Output:**

```json
{
  "pocket_id": 1,
  "score": 52.4,
  "center": [12.4, 5.7, -3.1],
  "residues": ["A12", "U13", "G14"]
}
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ BioGPT (Local LLM)

* Analyzes structure + pocket data to predict:

  * Biomarker regions
  * Structural motifs
  * Function (ligand/metal binding)
  * Disease relevance
* Enhanced with **RAG** for incorporating external biomedical knowledge
* Can also suggest **drug candidates** via SMILES and diffusion-based reasoning (demonstrative)

**Example Output:**

```json
{
  "predicted_biomarker_region": "Residues A12‚ÄìG14",
  "structural_motif": "hairpin loop",
  "function": "metal ion binding",
  "associated_disease": "Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD)",
  "potential_drugs": ["CCO", "CCN", "C1=CC=CC=C1"]
}
```

## üß© Input and Output (Agentic AI Workflow)

### Input

An RNA Gene Sequence Expression (e.g., `8RBJ`)

### Workflow Steps

1. Generates 3D structure of RNA gene
2. Biomarker detection to locate pockets present in the 3D structure
3. BioGPT to find suitable drugs for the detected pockets
4. Enhanced drugs for targeted and personalized therapy

### Output Example

```json
{
  "predicted_biomarker_region": "Residues A12‚ÄìG14",
  "structural_motif": "hairpin loop",
  "function": "metal ion binding",
